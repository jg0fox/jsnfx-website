*Check content* is a command line interface (CLI) tool that scans code bases for content issues. First it extracts text from HTML, JSX, or TSX files, then it auto-detects industry, and finally it sends extracted content paired with a system prompt to a GPT-4o API. The API evaluates the text against industry best-practice content standards, inclusive language, plain language, and accessibility standards, returning violations with suggestions.

It's one of my answers to the decline in cross-functional consultation.

## Pattern matching industry detection

*Check content* attempts to automatically detect an app's industry so that it can provide industry-specific content standards.

First, it scans for definitive indicators like stock symbols or medical terms that clearly identify an industry. If it doesn't find any, it falls back to weighted pattern matching across content, dependencies, and file structures.

```javascript
function detectIndustry(codebaseData) {
  const allText = combineAllSources(codebaseData);

  for (const [industry, patterns] of industries) {
    // Check definitive indicators first
    const definitiveMatches = patterns.definitiveIndicators
      .filter(term => allText.includes(term.toLowerCase()));

    if (definitiveMatches.length > 0) {
      return {
        industry,
        confidence: 0.9 + bonusCalculation(definitiveMatches),
        source: 'definitive_indicators'
      };
    }

    // Fall back to pattern matching
    const patternScore = calculatePatternScore(codebaseData, patterns);
  }
}
```

The tool currently supports six industries, each with specialized rules. Healthcare apps get HIPAA compliance content standards and person-first language checks. Finance gets regulatory compliance and risk disclosure rules. E-commerce apps get product clarity and conversion optimization guidance.

### Refinement: fintech trading platform

I tested *Check content* with a friend's cryptocurrency trading prototype. I was intrigued to see that the industry detection algorithm consistently classified it as a gaming app with 70% confidence even though there was clear financial terminology.

After investigating, it turned out that application contained gaming terms like "Alpha Leaderboard", "Win Rate", and "Trading Arena" that overwhelmed financial indicators like "Stock Symbol", "TSLA Position Alert", and "Total Portfolio", resulting in an inaccurate analysis.

```javascript
// Content that triggered gaming detection:
"Alpha Leaderboard"     // Strong gaming signal
"Win Rate"              // Gaming terminology
"Trading Arena"         // "Arena" suggests competitive gaming

// Financial signals that were overwhelmed:
"Stock Symbol"          // Should indicate finance
"TSLA Position Alert"   // Clear stock reference
"Total Portfolio"       // Financial terminology
```

I used Claude Code and some common sense to enhance the definitive indicator system to prioritize financial terms and added special handling for stock symbols.

## Standards and analysis

![Check content architecture](/projects/check-content/check-content-diagram.png)

The standards are based on three authoritative sources:

1. **Atlassian Design System** - Bold, optimistic, practical voice with inclusive language
2. **Atlassian Inclusive Writing Guidelines** - Gender-neutral pronouns, avoiding exclusionary terms
3. **California Innovation Hub Principles** - Plain language (8th grade reading level), conversational tone

The system prompt is a ~210-line constant that is passed to GPT-4o as the system message in the OpenAI chat completion call.

### Key Standards Categories

| Category | Severity | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Inclusive Language** | error | guys→everyone, blacklist→blocklist, manpower→workforce |
| **Pronoun Guidelines** | warning | he/she→they, his/her→their |
| **Plain Language** | warning | utilize→use, facilitate→help, paradigm→model |
| **Active Voice** | warning | "was created"→"created", "is being processed"→"processes" |
| **Missing Alt Text** | error | Images without alt attributes |
| **Non-descriptive Links** | warning | "click here"→descriptive text |

### Prohibited Terms (Partial List)

The system prompt includes 50+ prohibited terms:

**Gender-exclusive:**
- guys, dudes, bros → team, everyone, folks
- mankind → humanity, people
- manpower → workforce, staff
- businessman, freshman → business people, first-year student

**Tech legacy terms:**
- master/slave → primary/secondary, main/replica
- blacklist/whitelist → blocklist/allowlist

**Ableist language:**
- crazy/insane → surprising, unexpected
- blind spot → gap, oversight
- lame → disappointing, weak

**Jargon to simplify:**
- utilize, leverage → use
- facilitate → help, enable
- optimize, streamline → improve, simplify
- synergize, ideate → work together, brainstorm
- paradigm, methodology → model, method
