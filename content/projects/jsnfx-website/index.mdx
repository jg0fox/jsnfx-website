## The challenge

As a senior content designer, I needed a portfolio that would do more than just list projects — it needed to reflect my craft and attention to detail while remaining easy to maintain and extend.

Most portfolio templates felt either too corporate and sterile, or too flashy and distracting from the work itself. I wanted something that felt **grounded, approachable, and crafted** — like a well-curated study filled with plants and natural light.

## Design direction

The aesthetic draws from organic, natural themes:

- **Grounded** — earthy greens and warm linens, natural textures, thoughtful typography
- **Approachable** — warm without being casual, professional without being cold
- **Crafted** — attention to detail that suggests care and intentionality
- **Distinctive** — memorable without being flashy

The color palette centers on Palm Leaf greens against a Soft Linen background, with Bronze Spice as an accent for calls-to-action and highlights.

## Technical approach

The site is built with **Next.js 14+** using the App Router for excellent Vercel integration and React Server Components. Styling uses **Tailwind CSS v4** for utility-first development and easy theming. All content lives in **MDX** files — Markdown with React components — making it easy to author and maintain. **TypeScript** in strict mode catches errors early, and the whole thing deploys to **Vercel** with zero configuration.

### Content architecture

Portfolio and project content lives in MDX files with frontmatter metadata. This structure makes it easy to add new portfolio pieces — just create a folder, add an `index.mdx` with the right frontmatter, and the site handles the rest.

### Mobile-first responsive design

Every component was built mobile-first, with breakpoint modifiers for larger screens. The sidebar transforms into a slide-out drawer on mobile, and portfolio grids adapt from 1 column on phones to 2-3 columns on desktop.

## Content migration with an LLM-powered crawler

Before building the new site, I needed to migrate content from my existing Webflow portfolio. Rather than manually copying and reformatting everything, I built a custom web crawler that uses Claude to intelligently extract and transform the content.

The crawler uses **Playwright** (a headless browser) to handle JavaScript-rendered content, then sends each page to **Claude** for intelligent extraction.

### How it works

Claude's tool use feature enables structured output. Two tools work together:

1. **extract_page_content** — Returns clean markdown, title, page type, summary, and tags
2. **name_images** — Generates descriptive, contextual filenames for each image

The system transforms generic CDN URLs like `cdn.prod.website-files.com/abc123.png` into meaningful names like `robinhood-trading-dashboard.png`.

### Filtering decorative images

A key challenge was filtering out decorative images (icons, checkmarks, navigation elements) while preserving meaningful content. The solution combines multiple signals: URL pattern matching, dimension checking (skip images under 100×100px), accessibility hints, and alt text analysis.

### Results

The final crawl processed **12 pages** and downloaded **87 images** with contextual names. Total API cost was about **$0.80** and processing took roughly **7 minutes**. Each page produced clean markdown with images embedded at their correct positions — ready to drop into the new MDX content system.

### Lessons learned

- **LLMs are inconsistent with multi-tool calls** — Always implement fallback mechanisms when expecting multiple tool responses
- **Decorative filtering requires multiple signals** — URL patterns alone aren't sufficient
- **Playwright over requests** — For modern JavaScript-heavy sites, headless browsers are more reliable
- **Prompt for inclusion, not exclusion** — "Include content images, skip only tiny icons" works better than "skip decorative images"

## Building with Claude Code

This project was built collaboratively using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/code), Anthropic's AI-powered CLI tool. The workflow enabled rapid iteration across four phases: foundation setup, component building, content system implementation, and polish.

The AI pair-programming approach was particularly valuable for quickly scaffolding new components matching existing patterns, debugging tricky issues (like MDX hydration errors), and iterating on visual details through rapid feedback cycles.

## Key features

- **Component-driven architecture** — Reusable UI components ensure consistency
- **MDX content** — Write portfolio pieces in Markdown with embedded React components
- **Automatic portfolio navigation** — Previous/next links generated from content
- **Responsive images** — Next.js Image component with proper sizing hints
- **Accessible** — Keyboard navigable, proper heading hierarchy, focus states
- **Performance optimized** — Static generation where possible, optimized images

## What I learned

Building my own portfolio from scratch reinforced a few principles:

1. **Content-first design** — The best portfolio sites get out of the way of the work
2. **Componentization pays off** — Time spent on reusable components saves time later
3. **Mobile is not an afterthought** — Designing mobile-first leads to better decisions
4. **Iteration beats perfection** — Ship early, refine continuously

## Status and roadmap

The site is live and actively maintained. Planned improvements include adding more portfolio case studies, a writing section for articles and thoughts, dark mode support, and animation refinements with reduced motion support.
