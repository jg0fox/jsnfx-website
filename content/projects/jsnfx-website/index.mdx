## The problem with portfolio sites

Most portfolio templates optimize for the wrong thing. They're either over-designed (look at my animations!) or under-considered (here's a grid of thumbnails). Neither approach actually *serves the work*.

I wanted something different: a system that gets out of the way while still reflecting craft. Think of it like a well-curated study — plants, natural light, everything in its place. The container matters, but it's not the point.

## Design direction

The aesthetic is organic and grounded:

- **Earthy greens and warm linens** over sterile whites and blues
- **Warm but professional** — approachable without sliding into casual
- **Details that reward attention** — typography, spacing, transitions that feel intentional
- **Distinctive without being loud** — memorable because it's considered, not because it's flashy

The palette centers on Palm Leaf greens against Soft Linen, with Bronze Spice for moments that need emphasis.

## The stack (and why)

**Next.js 14+** with App Router — React Server Components play well with content-heavy sites, and Vercel deployment is effectively zero-config.

**Tailwind CSS v4** — Utility-first means I can iterate on visual details without context-switching between files. Theming is straightforward.

**MDX for content** — Markdown with embedded React components. This is the key architectural decision. Content lives in `.mdx` files with frontmatter metadata, which means adding a new portfolio piece is just: create folder, add `index.mdx`, done. The system handles routing, navigation, and metadata automatically.

**TypeScript in strict mode** — Catches entire categories of bugs before they ship.

## Content migration: building a smarter crawler

I had an existing Webflow portfolio with a dozen pages and nearly 90 images. The manual approach — copy, reformat, rename, organize — would have taken hours and introduced errors.

So I built a crawler that thinks.

The system uses **Playwright** to render JavaScript-heavy pages, then passes each page to **Claude** for intelligent extraction. Two tools work together:

1. **extract_page_content** — Returns structured output: clean markdown, title, page type, summary, tags
2. **name_images** — Transforms meaningless CDN URLs (`cdn.prod.website-files.com/abc123.png`) into contextual filenames (`robinhood-trading-dashboard.png`)

### The decorative image problem

Not every image on a page belongs in the content. Icons, checkmarks, navigation sprites — these need to be filtered out. URL patterns alone don't cut it.

The solution layers multiple signals: dimension thresholds (skip anything under 100×100px), URL pattern matching, accessibility attributes, and alt text analysis. No single signal is reliable; the combination is.

### Results

12 pages processed. 87 images downloaded with meaningful names. ~$0.80 in API costs. 7 minutes total.

Each page produced clean markdown with images positioned correctly — ready to drop into the MDX system without manual cleanup.

### What actually worked

- **Prompt for inclusion, not exclusion** — "Include content images, skip only tiny icons" outperformed "skip decorative images"
- **Playwright over requests** — Headless browsers are non-negotiable for modern JavaScript-rendered sites
- **Build fallbacks into multi-tool flows** — LLMs are inconsistent with parallel tool calls; design for graceful degradation

## The CMS: GitHub as a database (hear me out)

I needed a way to manage content without spinning up a database, paying for a headless CMS, or editing raw MDX files like a caveman.

The solution: a custom CMS that uses GitHub as the backend. Content lives in the repo. Edits commit directly via the GitHub API. No database, no sync issues, no monthly invoice.

**The stack:** Next.js + TypeScript, JWT auth via `jose`, GitHub Contents API for CRUD operations. Images get compressed client-side before committing to the repo.

**The workflow:** Log in → edit in a real UI → hit save → changes commit and deploy automatically via Vercel. Draft/publish flow included.

It's not clever infrastructure. It's *no* infrastructure. That's the point.

## Building with Claude Code

This project was a collaboration with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/code). The AI pair-programming model shines in specific contexts: scaffolding components that match existing patterns, debugging hydration errors, rapid iteration on visual details through fast feedback loops.

It's not magic — you still need to know what you're building. But it compresses the tedious parts.

## Architecture decisions that paid off

**Component-driven UI** — Reusable components enforce consistency without requiring discipline. The system makes the right thing easy.

**Automatic navigation** — Previous/next links generate from content metadata. Adding a portfolio piece doesn't require touching navigation code.

**Mobile-first, always** — Every component starts at the smallest breakpoint and scales up. This constraint produces better decisions than "desktop-first, then fix mobile."

**Static where possible** — Pre-rendered pages, optimized images, no unnecessary JavaScript. Performance isn't a feature; it's table stakes.

## What's next

The site is live. Ongoing work includes additional case studies, a writing section, dark mode, and refined animations with reduced-motion support.

The foundation is solid. Now it's about filling it with work worth showing.
