I was tasked with creating a "fun" game for content designers to play during a recent team on-site at Atlassian. After chatting with my amazing partner in language crime, Traci Wilbanks, we decided to create a task-based game inspired by the television game show "Taskmaster." 

I then asked Traci what types of material I should print out so that everyone could play the game together. And she quickly reprimanded me and said, "We don't need to kill any trees for this game, Jason. We can do it with computers." And that's when my inspiration hit, and I decided to design a web app for a multiplayer content design challenge game. 

## Game overview

Wordwrangler is a competitive writing game where players craft creative responses to absurd prompts. A facilitator runs the game while players compete individually to write the wittiest, most creative, and technically accurate responses.

## Game flow

### 1 Setup lobby
Facilitator creates game, sets rounds and timer. Players join with game code.

### 2 Team assignment lobby
Facilitator assigns players to teams (optional). Creates teams if needed.

### 3 Round begins active
Task appears on all screens. Timer starts. Players write responses on their devices.

 ### 4 Submissions
Players submit responses before timer ends. Display shows who has submitted.

### 5 Judging
Facilitator reviews all submissions, selects winner, awards 1-5 points.

### 6 Leaderboard
Current standings displayed. Facilitator advances to next round or ends game.

### 7 Reflection end
AI generates insights about team's responses in the style of the *Taskmaster* game show hosts.
