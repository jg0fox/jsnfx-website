The Tone Spectrum Explorer is an interactive tool designed for anyone interested in tone of voice to:

- **Define and explore tone of voice positioning** across 5 distinct tone spectrums using interactive sliders
- **Analyze sub-dimensions** of tone (4 unique sub-dimensions per spectrum)
- **Explore 50+ linguistic devices** with definitions, examples, and UX impact
- **Generate comprehensive content standards** following a structured schema
- **Detect anti-patterns** to identify conflicting tone signals
- **Export standards** as markdown files or copy to clipboard

## Inspiration
I spent years figuring out how to place the tone needle at a certain place on the spectrum.  it became an intuitive act for me, figuring out how to be more serious or playful, and all of the various linguistic and literary devices that I might use to do that, or to reverse engineer content to figure out how they did that.

 And over the years, I even documented this knowledge so that I could teach it to other people. But not everyone had the time, interest, or opportunity to learn the ins-and-outs of tone in the way that I had designed. And then, it all clicked. This interactive tool, which is really just a standalone HTML page with some CSS and JavaScript, takes my years of literary and linguistic documentation around tone of voice and places it into a tool that feels interactive, navigable, and also enriched with examples.

 ## It's a starting point

I wanted this tool to be a starting point for people to think more deeply about tone of voice in a way that would allow them to document their preferred tone of voice preferences and then carry those preferences forward into human and machine-readable formats. This is why I put together a tone of voice standard schema so that, based on where a user sets their particular spectrum, they can generate a content standard for that type of tone of voice and make good things happen.
