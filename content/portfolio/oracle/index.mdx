## Goals

Distill the voice and tone from 5 of Oracle's core products into a set of resources for the design team.

## My role

Audit Oracle's existing experiences, research, and public perception to discover the voice our brand had inherited and to design a set of tonal characteristics that would empower our enterprise users.

## Voice and tone mapping
