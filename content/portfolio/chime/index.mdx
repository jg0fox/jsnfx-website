## One interesting thing

The real win of this experiment is that I was able to convince a group of well-intentioned but headstrong stakeholders that specificity doesn't always equate to comprehension.

## Customer and team goals

1. Help Chime customers understand that they can send money to and request money from people who don't have Chime accounts
2. Increase payments and payment requests sent to non-Chime members
3. Extrapolate any research and findings to relevant product areas

## This is my process, this is not my process!

I draw inspiration from Jorge Arango's process for information architecture. I find that it is supremely applicable to content design and I try my best to apply it wherever and whenever possible.

## A 16% improvement

Our team performed an A/B test of this bottom sheet experience against the original interstitial fullscreen takeover experience. The result was a 16% improvement in member-to-guest payments/requests over the control.

## Sharing our team's insights

![Team insights and resources documentation](/portfolio/chime/design-resources-overview.png)

As the project progressed, I turned our content learnings into educational resources for the broader team, including a 2-minute problem/solution video for leadership and an async workshop for our design and cross-functional partners.

## The initial experience

![Original Chime payment experience screens](/portfolio/chime/chime-initial-user-experience.png)

This experiment aimed to improve an existing experience that consisted of two interstitial screens. The screens were triggered by a customer tapping "Pay Anyone" from the main navigation and had to be dismissed in order for the customer to land at the Pay Anyone screen.
