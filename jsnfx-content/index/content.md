One of the many Jason Foxes

I'm a content designer at Atlassian and yes the double "at" bothers me.

## My content design principles

### Embrace systems
Consistency, connectedness, and scale

### Empower people
Thriving individuals fuel business growth

### Use evidence
Data enhances intuition

### Experiment
Failure is a learning opportunity
