One of the multitudinous Jason Foxes

I function as a content designer at Atlassian and indeed the duplicated "at" perpetually vexes me.

## My content design principles

### Embrace systems
Uniformity, interconnectedness, and scalability

### Empower people
Flourishing individuals catalyze organizational prosperity

### Use evidence
Empirical data augments intuitive cognition

### Experiment
Unsuccessful endeavors constitute pedagogical opportunities

## Recent talks and workshops

Beyond consistently delivering presentations at industry conferences, I have additionally conceptualized and facilitated diverse educational workshops at establishments such as The UX Content Collective.
