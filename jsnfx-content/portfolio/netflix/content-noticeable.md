# Content design considerations for Netflix payments

Content design theories, frameworks, and content components for Netflix payments experimentation.

In this case study, I leverage my experience as a content designer and UX research analyst to develop a comprehensive set of content design theories, frameworks, and content components that could establish the groundwork for Netflix payments experimentation initiatives.

*This represents an external case study — I am not presently employed by Netflix.*

At Baymard, we executed comprehensive usability research initiatives. Collaborating with a team, I developed a detailed report based on insights from 185 participants utilizing the "Think Aloud" methodology. From this extensive investigation, I want to emphasize six strategic recommendations that could provide substantial value to Netflix.

All findings presented here were derived from my professional work at The Baymard Institute and Chime.

## Six strategic recommendations

1. **Clarifying Third-Party Payment Solutions:** Several participants demonstrated reluctance regarding third-party payment alternatives due to ambiguity—such as being redirected to external platforms. To increase user confidence, consider providing upfront explanations about how these payment solutions integrate seamlessly into your workflow.

2. **Strategic Security Badge Positioning:** A more intentional placement for the security badge, positioned closer to the credit card input field, could potentially enhance user trust when customers are entering sensitive information.

3. **Visual Trust Indicators:** Implement design elements such as borders or subtle shading around the credit card input field. These nuanced visual cues can frequently communicate security more effectively than lengthy textual explanations.

4. **Action-Oriented Payment Selections:** Instead of static labels like "Credit Card", consider implementing action-oriented language such as "Pay with a Credit or Debit card". This approach doesn't merely communicate the payment method but establishes expectations for the subsequent steps, effectively directing user behavior.

5. **Left-Aligned Content Structure:** Users consistently demonstrated preference for left-aligned content over centered layouts. This represents an established usability convention that Netflix could potentially leverage, particularly within the payment workflow.

6. **Appropriate Tone Selection:** Particularly within payment contexts, maintaining a neutral tone is essential. Excessively casual or emotional language can undermine user confidence. We must achieve an appropriate balance in tone, especially when handling sensitive data collection processes.

## Four strategic theories

I've developed a comprehensive set of four content theories to support my content frameworks. I utilized 18F's hypothesis methodology to establish clear objectives and enable effective learning throughout the experimentation process.

Here's an illustration of how the theory content cards appear.

**We believe** that doing/building/creating **[this]** for **[this user]**

**will result** in **[this outcome]**.

**We'll know we're right** when we see **[this metric/signal]**.

[The 18F Design Hypothesis](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/design-hypothesis/)

**Theory 1:** Clarifying third-party payment alternatives we believe that providing clear explanations about how third-party payment alternatives operate will eliminate confusion about the subsequent workflow and can minimize hesitation to proceed for potential Netflix subscribers. We'll know we're successful when we observe increased clickthrough and completion rates on step 3 of payment configuration.

**Theory 2:** Strengthening security perception we believe that visually reinforcing input fields during sensitive data collection moments and repositioning the security badge will result in enhanced security perception for Netflix subscribers. We'll know we're successful when we observe reduced abandonments or decreased time spent on payment information entry interfaces.

**Theory 3:** Positioning payment selections as actionable tasks we believe that positioning payment selections as actionable tasks will more effectively prepare subscribers for the subsequent workflow process. We'll know we're successful when we observe improved clickthrough on payment selection interfaces and reduced bounce rates during payment data collection.

**Theory 4:** Implementing a balanced tone of voice we believe that implementing a more balanced tone of voice throughout the payment experience will create an experience that better aligns with what many subscribers consider appropriate, which will result in enhanced confidence in the payment workflow.

## The theory card elements in Figma

Each theory card functions as a Figma component within the accompanying design documentation.

Within the Figma design documentation for this initiative, I constructed a component system featuring four theory variations. Each theory is combined with content frameworks and incorporates relevant demonstrations. You'll also discover there are "aligned" and "misaligned" states available so you can properly annotate your design documentation.

## Figma content framework

The framework is structured by content component type and theory.

Additionally, this initiative's Figma design documentation incorporates a content framework. This framework is structured along two dimensions. The Y dimension identifies the content component type, such as heading, body text, button copy, etc. The X dimension indicates which theory the content supports, encompassing all 4, plus a comprehensive option that integrates all theories.

You may find this component valuable because with a single component instance, you can generate all the text elements you might require to populate a payment method selection interface.
