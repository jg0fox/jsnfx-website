# Content design considerations for Netflix payments

Content design theories, guidelines, and content pieces for Netflix payments tests.

In this case study, I pull from my work as a content designer and UX research analyst to build a set of content design theories, guidelines, and content pieces that could work as the base for Netflix payments tests.

*This is an outside case study — I am not currently working at Netflix.*

At Baymard, we ran detailed usability research. With a team, I wrote a report based on feedback of 185 people using the "Think Aloud" method. From this full study, I want to share six tips that could help Netflix.

All findings here came from my work at The Baymard Institute and Chime.

## Six recommendations

1. **Making Third-Party Payments Clear:** Some people were unsure about third-party payment ways due to doubt—like going to another site. To build trust, think about explaining up front how these payments work with your flow.

2. **Security Badge Position:** A smart spot for the security badge, closer to the credit card area, could improve trust when users enter private details.

3. **Visual Support:** Use design hints like borders or shading on the credit card area. These simple visual clues can often show security better than long explanations.

4. **Action-Based Payment Options:** Instead of labels like "Credit Card", try action prompts such as "Pay with a Credit or Debit card". It doesn't just show the method but prepares for what comes next, leading user actions.

5. **Left-Side Text:** Users always found left-aligned content easier to read than centered. It's a known usability rule that Netflix could use, especially in the payment flow.

6. **Tone Is Key:** Especially in payment cases, a neutral tone is vital. Too playful or emotional tones can hurt trust. We need to find the right balance in tone, especially when handling sensitive data entry.

## Four hypotheses

I've built a set of four content theories to go with my content guidelines. I used 18F's theory structure to make goals clear and help learning during the testing phase.

Here's what the theory content cards look like.

**We believe** that doing/building/creating **[this]** for **[this user]**

**will result** in **[this outcome]**.

**We'll know we're right** when we see **[this metric/signal]**.

[The 18F Design Hypothesis](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/design-hypothesis/)

**Hypothesis 1:** Explaining third-party payment choices we believe that clearly explaining how third-party payment choices work will solve confusion about the next flow and can reduce doubt to take action for future Netflix customers. We'll know we're right when we see higher clickthrough and completion rates on step 3 of payment setup.

**Hypothesis 2:** Making security perception better we believe that visually supporting text input areas at the moment of sensitive data input and moving the security badge will result in a better perception of security for Netflix customers. We'll know we're right when we see fewer abandonments or less time spent on payment details entry screens.

**Hypothesis 3:** Making payment options into actions we believe that making payment options into actions will better prepare customers for the coming task flow. We'll know we're right when we see more clickthrough on payment selection screens and lower bounce rate during payment data input.

**Hypothesis 4:** Using a neutral tone of voice we believe that using a more neutral tone of voice in the payment experience will create an experience that's more in line with what some customers feel is right, which will result in better trust of the payment flow.

## The hypothesis card parts in Figma

Each theory card exists as a Figma part in the matching design file.

Within the Figma design file for this project, I made a part set with four theory versions. Each theory is matched with content guidelines and has relevant examples. You'll also find that there is an "aligned" and "not aligned" state so you can mark your design files as needed.

## Figma content grid

The grid is set up by content piece type and theory.

Finally, this project's Figma design file also has a content grid. This grid is set up along two lines. The Y line shows the content piece type, like heading, body, button text, etc. The X line shows which theory the content matches with, including all 4, plus a choice that puts all theories together.

You might find this part useful because with a single part instance, you can create all the text layers you might need to fill a payment method selector screen.
