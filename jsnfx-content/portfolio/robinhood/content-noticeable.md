## Beth Dunn, and then some

Let's examine Beth Dunn's comprehensive content design framework for a moment. It demonstrates the breadth of capabilities I employed and the methodologies I implemented throughout this project.

While Beth's framework establishes the groundwork with Scope, Structure, and Surface, I've incorporated an additional Systems layer given the extensive legal and compliance oversight necessary for this initiative.

It's important to recognize that this portfolio presentation showcases key project milestones, rather than a sequential or linear walkthrough of design stages.

## Problem definition

Journey mapping enables me and my collaborators to identify what we understand, what remains unclear, and how to proceed effectively.

For Robinhood's 24 Hour Market project, we recognized that numerous customers faced challenges participating in stock trading because their employment or family obligations conflicted with standard market hours. The prospect of making after-hours trading more approachable for mainstream users presented an compelling opportunity.

I facilitated a journey mapping session with cross-functional team members to explore how this opportunity could materialize within our primary stock trading workflows.

*Establishing the problem at the scope layer.*

## Experimenting within constraints

Delivering customers a comprehensive understanding of how a stock's bid/ask spread should guide their selected limit order price represented a fundamental objective of the 24 Hour Market experience.

Our current market data modal interface already appeared conceptually complex. As we introduced explanatory content, the complexity intensified and we started to obscure our primary bid/ask spread messaging.

We questioned ourselves regarding the appropriate level of responsibility to assign this modal interface.

Our agreement was: Sufficient to minimize risk, facilitate action, and encourage additional experimentation.

*Emphasizing usability at the structure layer.*

## Clarity and cohesion through Object Oriented UX

As demonstrated in our investigation of explaining the bid/ask spread to help customers make better-informed limit price decisions, it became apparent that we were addressing ongoing conceptual complexity. This can not only make challenging tasks harder to master, but can also make an entire product or feature feel more unwieldy and problematic.

Object Oriented UX methodologies, such as outlining objects, actions, and their corresponding attributes, can establish a solid structural foundation for development. This framework will help us prevent ambiguity and inconsistency over time, while also enabling us to consider the broader content ecosystem collaboratively.

## Setting expectations by modulating tone

In my UX content perspective, tone encompasses two components: substance and sound.

When these components align, we can successfully adjust our tone to address various scenarios.

A concept that frequently emerges in Robinhood's review and critique discussions is the notion of a term of art, which represents a word or phrase carrying specific meaning within a particular industry that differs from its common usage.

In finance, we encounter words like *portfolio* and *execute*. These terms significantly influence the Robinhood voice and tone.

Let's examine the word *execute* since I know you're curious.

Does it align with our preferred voice or tone? Perhaps not. Is it intimidating and complex? Possibly yes. Must a customer comprehend this word's meaning to successfully navigate equity trading? Almost certainly.

This single word delivers significant tonal impact. It encompasses both sound and substance elements with numerous glottal stops that create friction, while also being conceptually dense with multiple associations. Including murder, of course.

My justification for incorporating *execute* is that it represents beneficial friction and that the domain knowledge it provides to Robinhood customers surpasses any negative connotations.

*Developing deliberate tone at the surface layer.*

## Collaborating with legal and compliance

Robinhood, a publicly traded financial institution facing considerable public oversight, maintains strict adherence to numerous legal and compliance requirements.

The legal and compliance workflow, though challenging, aligns closely with what I consider optimal practices for quality UX writing.

In the 24 Hour Market onboarding sequence that introduces customers to bid/ask spread information, we underwent extensive tooltip revisions to ensure compliance with the SEC's Regulation Best Interest. In the provided example, you can observe some subtle and obvious distinctions.

## Governing content in development and for the long haul

Compliance and legal oversight represents an continuous process across all project phases.
In this environment, meticulous version management distinguishes chaos from cohesion.

Utilizing component sets to oversee content throughout these reviews and into engineering handoff helped ensure we exclusively delivered legally and compliance-approved content. It also enabled us to record our decision-making process to minimize confusion in subsequent projects.

*Overseeing and scaling content at the systems layer.*

## The before, after, and sweet hereafter

This initiative demanded a staged methodology. We began by implementing minimal modifications to current experiences which established the 24 Hour market foundation. We subsequently explored pathways toward a more intuitive 24 Hour market onboarding journey.
