## Beth Dunn, and then some

Let us momentarily examine Beth Dunn's comprehensive full-stack content design methodology. It elucidates the breadth of competencies I deployed and the methodological frameworks I implemented throughout the duration of this undertaking.

While Dunn's stratified architecture establishes fundamental parameters through Scope, Structure, and Surface delineations, I have incorporated an additional Systems stratum owing to the substantial regulatory and compliance oversight requisite for this particular initiative.

It bears acknowledgment that this portfolio exposition constitutes a curated examination of project culminations, rather than a chronologically sequential or linearly progressive navigation through discrete design phases.

## Problem definition

Journey mapping facilitates my comprehension and that of collaborative stakeholders regarding extant knowledge, epistemological lacunae, and subsequent procedural imperatives.

Concerning Robinhood's 24 Hour Market proposition, we discerned that numerous clientele encountered impediments to equity market participation due to occupational obligations or familial caregiving responsibilities coinciding with conventional trading hours. The prospect of democratizing extended-hours market accessibility for broader demographic constituencies presented considerable potential.

I orchestrated a journey mapping workshop encompassing cross-functional stakeholders to comprehend how this opportunity might manifest within our fundamental equity trading ecosystems.

*Delineating the problematic parameters at the scope stratum.*

## Experimenting within constraints

Furnishing customers with lucid comprehension regarding how a security's bid/ask differential should inform their selected limit order valuation constituted a fundamental objective of the 24 Hour Market experience.

Our pre-existing market data modal interface already exhibited substantial conceptual density. Upon incorporating explanatory content, the informational saturation exponentially intensified, consequently obscuring our primary bid/ask differential messaging.

We interrogated ourselves regarding the appropriate degree of functional responsibility to assign this modal interface.

Our collective determination was: Sufficient to mitigate risk exposure, facilitate transactional capabilities, and stimulate additional experimental engagement.

*Concentrating on usability considerations at the structural stratum.*

## Clarity and cohesion through Object Oriented UX

As demonstrated through our exploratory approach to elucidating the bid/ask differential to enable more informed limit price selection by customers, it became apparent that we confronted persistent conceptual density challenges. This phenomenon not only complicates the acquisition of complex procedural knowledge but can render a product or feature holistically more cumbersome and friction-laden.

Object Oriented UX methodologies, including the systematic mapping of objects, actions, and their corresponding attributes, facilitate the establishment of robust structural foundations for subsequent development. This architectural framework assists in circumventing ambiguity and inconsistency over extended timeframes, while simultaneously enabling collaborative team-based consideration of the broader content ecosystem.

## Setting expectations by modulating tone

Within my UX content conceptualization, tonal characteristics comprise dual components: substantive elements and auditory qualities.

When these constituents converge harmoniously, we achieve effective tonal modulation accommodating diverse use case scenarios.

A frequently recurring theme in Robinhood's evaluative and critique sessions involves the concept of specialized terminology, which encompasses words or phrases possessing domain-specific meanings within particular fields that diverge from their conventional interpretations.

In financial contexts, we encounter lexical items such as *portfolio* and *execute*. These terminological elements significantly influence the Robinhood vocal identity and tonal characteristics.

Let us examine the word *execute* given its anticipated interest.

Does it align with our aspirational voice or tonal objectives? Potentially not. Does it convey intimidating and dense connotations? Possibly affirmative. Must customers comprehend this term's meaning to effectively navigate equities trading environments? Almost certainly.

This singular lexical unit delivers substantial tonal impact. It encompasses both auditory and substantive elements through numerous glottal stops creating considerable friction, while simultaneously being conceptually dense with multiple associative meanings. One such association involves homicide.

My justification for *execute* inclusion is that it represents beneficial friction and that the domain expertise it confers upon Robinhood customers supersedes negative associative implications.

*Establishing intentional tonality at the surface stratum.*

## Collaborating with legal and compliance

Robinhood, functioning as a publicly traded financial institution subjected to extensive public oversight, maintains rigorous adherence to various regulatory and compliance requirements.

The legal and compliance procedural framework, despite its cumbersome nature, aligns substantially with what I consider optimal practices for quality UX writing methodologies.

Within the 24 Hour Market onboarding sequence introducing customers to bid/ask differential data, we underwent extensive iterative revisions of tooltip content to ensure SEC Regulation Best Interest compliance. In the accompanying example, you can observe both nuanced and conspicuous variations.

## Governing content in development and for the long haul

Compliance and legal review constitutes an ongoing procedural requirement throughout all project phases.
Within this environmental context, meticulous version control distinguishes between chaotic dysfunction and systematic cohesion.

Employing component sets to manage content throughout these reviews and into engineering handoff facilitated our assurance that exclusively legal and compliance-approved content reached production deployment. This approach additionally documented our decision-making rationale to minimize procedural redundancy in subsequent projects.

*Managing and scaling content at the systems stratum.*

## The before, after, and sweet hereafter

This project necessitated a phased implementation approach. We commenced by developing low-impact modifications to existing experiences serving as foundational elements for the 24 Hour market. Subsequently, we explored pathways toward more intuitive 24 Hour market onboarding experiences.
