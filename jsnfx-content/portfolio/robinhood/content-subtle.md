## Beth Dunn, and then some

Let's talk for a bit about Beth Dunn's full-stack content design model. It shows the range of skills I used and the work I did while building this project.

While Beth's stack starts with Scope, Structure, and Surface, I've added a Systems layer because of the high level of legal and compliance work needed for this project.

It's worth noting that this portfolio presentation is a tour of the project highlights, not a step-by-step or linear journey through design phases.

## Problem definition

Journey mapping helps me and the people I work with figure out what we know, what we don't know, and what to do next.

For Robinhood's 24 Hour Market project, we knew that many of our customers had trouble taking part in the stock market because they worked jobs or cared for families during normal market hours. The chance to make the after hours market easier to access for everyday people was very exciting.

I ran a journey mapping workshop with my cross-team partners to understand how this chance might work within our main stock trading experiences.

*Defining the problem at the scope layer.*

## Experimenting within limits

Giving customers a clear sense of how a stock's bid/ask spread should guide their chosen limit order price was a key goal of the 24 Hour Market experience.

Our current market data modal window already felt packed with concepts. When we started to add helpful content, the density grew and we started to lose sight of our main bid/ask spread messages.

We asked ourselves how much work we should give this modal window.

Our agreement was: Enough to reduce risk, enable action, and inspire more trying things out.

*Focusing on usability at the structure layer.*

## Clarity and unity through Object Oriented UX

As shown in our work on explaining the bid/ask spread so that customers can make a better informed limit price choice, it was clear that we were dealing with ongoing concept density. Not only can this make hard tasks more difficult to learn, it can make a product or feature as a whole feel more clunky and full of friction.

Object Oriented UX methods, like mapping out objects, actions, and their related parts, can help create a solid structural layer to build upon. This structure will help us avoid confusion and mixed messages in the long run, but it also helps us think about the larger content world as a team.

## Setting expectations by adjusting tone

In my UX content thinking, tone has two parts: substance and sound.

When these parts work together, we're able to effectively adjust our tone to work for a variety of use cases.

Something that comes up often in Robinhood's review and feedback sessions is the idea of a term of art, which is a word or phrase that has a specific meaning in a certain field that differs from its general meaning.

In finance, we have words like *portfolio* and *execute*. These terms play a big role in shaping the Robinhood tone of voice.

Let's talk about the word *execute* because I know you want to.

Is it within our desired voice or tone? Maybe not. Is it scary and dense? Maybe yes. Does a customer need to understand what the word means to effectively move through the world of stock trading? Almost definitely.

This 1 word packs a tone punch. It covers both sound and substance parts with lots of hard stops that make it very rough and it's also conceptually dense with lots of connections. One of which is murder.

My thinking for including *execute* is that it's a moment of good friction and that the field knowledge it gives to Robinhood customers is more important than the negative connections.

*Creating an intentional tone at the surface layer.*

## Working with legal and compliance

Robinhood, a publicly traded financial company with lots of public attention, very strictly follows various legal and compliance rules.

The legal and compliance process, although heavy, is very much in line with what I think are best ways to do quality UX writing.

In the 24 Hour Market onboarding tour that shows customers the bid/ask spread data, we went through many revisions of tooltips to make sure they followed the SEC's Regulation Best Interest. In the attached example, you can see some of the small and not-so-small differences.

## Managing content in development and for the long term

Compliance and legal review is an ongoing process throughout all project stages.
In this type of setting, careful version control makes the difference between chaos and unity.

Using component sets to manage content during these reviews and into handoff with engineering helped us make sure that we only shipped legal and compliance-approved content. It also helped us record our decision making to reduce back-and-forth in future projects.

*Managing and scaling content at the systems layer.*

## The before, after, and sweet hereafter

This project needed a staged approach. We started by creating easy changes to current experiences which served as the base of the 24 Hour market. We then explored our way toward a more natural 24 Hour market onboarding experience.
