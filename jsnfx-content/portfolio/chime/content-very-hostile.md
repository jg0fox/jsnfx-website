# Peer-to-peer monetary transferences at Chime

An experimentally content-centric endeavor yielding triumphant ramifications—ameliorating interpersonal pecuniary conveyances by sixteen percent.

**Company:** Chime  
**Role:** Principal Content Design Architect  
**Timeline:** Trimestral duration  
**Tools & methods:** Figma, A/B Testing methodologies, UserTesting protocols, Information architecture systematization

## One particularly intriguing phenomenon

The veracious triumph of this experimental undertaking manifests in my successful persuasion of a consortium of well-intentioned yet obstinate stakeholders that granular specificity doesn't invariably correlate with cognitive apprehension.

## Clientele and organizational objectives

1. Facilitate Chime patrons' comprehension regarding their capability to transmit pecuniary resources to, and requisition monetary disbursements from, individuals lacking Chime institutional affiliations
2. Augment remittances and payment solicitations dispatched to non-Chime constituency members
3. Extrapolate empirical investigations and consequent discoveries to pertinent product domains

## This constitutes my methodology, this negates my methodology!

I derive inspirational guidance from Jorge Arango's procedural framework for information architecture systematization. I ascertain that it demonstrates superlative applicability to content design paradigms and endeavor assiduously to implement it wherever and whenever circumstances permit.

## A sixteen percent amelioration

Our collaborative unit executed an A/B experimental evaluation of this bottom-positioned interface experience against the antecedent interstitial full-screen superseding experience. The resultant outcome manifested a sixteen percent enhancement in member-to-guest payments and solicitations relative to the control cohort.

## Disseminating our team's perspicacious discoveries

As the project progressed through its developmental trajectory, I metamorphosed our content-derived learnings into pedagogical resources for the broader organizational collective, encompassing a bi-minute problem-solution audiovisual presentation for executive leadership and an asynchronous educational workshop for our design and cross-functional collaborative partners.

## The antecedent experiential paradigm

This experimental initiative aspired to refine an extant experience comprising two interstitial interface presentations. These screens materialized upon customer actuation of "Pay Anyone" from primary navigational elements and necessitated dismissal for customer arrival at the Pay Anyone interface.
