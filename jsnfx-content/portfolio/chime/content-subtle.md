# Peer-to-peer payments at Chime

A content-focused experiment with winning outcomes—improving peer-to-peer payments by 16%.

**Company:** Chime  
**Role:** Lead Content Designer  
**Timeline:** 3 months  
**Tools & methods:** Figma, A/B Testing, UserTesting, Information architecture

## One interesting thing

The true success of this experiment is that I managed to convince a group of well-meaning but stubborn stakeholders that being specific doesn't always mean better understanding.

## Customer and team goals

1. Help Chime customers learn that they can send money to and ask for money from people who don't have Chime accounts
2. Boost payments and payment requests sent to non-Chime members
3. Apply any research and findings to other relevant product areas

## This is my process, this is not my process!

I take inspiration from Jorge Arango's approach to information architecture. I find that it works extremely well for content design and I try my best to use it wherever and whenever I can.

## A 16% improvement

Our team ran an A/B test of this bottom sheet experience against the original fullscreen takeover experience. The outcome was a 16% boost in member-to-guest payments/requests compared to the control.

## Sharing our team's insights

As the project moved forward, I turned our content lessons into learning resources for the wider team, including a 2-minute problem/solution video for leadership and an async workshop for our design and cross-functional partners.

## The initial experience

This experiment aimed to improve an existing experience that had two popup screens. The screens appeared when a customer tapped "Pay Anyone" from the main menu and had to be closed for the customer to reach the Pay Anyone screen.
