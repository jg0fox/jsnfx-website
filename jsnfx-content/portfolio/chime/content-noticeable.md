# Peer-to-peer payments at Chime

A content-focused experiment delivering exceptional outcomes—enhancing peer-to-peer payments by 16%.

**Company:** Chime  
**Role:** Lead Content Designer  
**Timeline:** 3 months  
**Tools & methods:** Figma, A/B Testing, UserTesting, Information architecture

## One compelling insight

The genuine success of this experiment lies in my ability to persuade a team of well-meaning yet determined stakeholders that precision doesn't necessarily translate to understanding.

## Customer and team objectives

1. Assist Chime customers in recognizing they can transfer money to and request funds from individuals without Chime accounts
2. Boost payments and payment requests directed to non-Chime users
3. Apply any research and discoveries to applicable product domains

## This represents my approach, this doesn't represent my approach!

I derive guidance from Jorge Arango's methodology for information architecture. I believe it's exceptionally relevant to content design and I strive to implement it wherever and whenever feasible.

## A 16% enhancement

Our team conducted an A/B test comparing this bottom sheet experience against the original interstitial fullscreen overlay experience. The outcome yielded a 16% improvement in member-to-guest payments and requests compared to the control group.

## Disseminating our team's discoveries

Throughout the project's evolution, I transformed our content insights into learning materials for the wider team, including a 2-minute problem/solution presentation for leadership and an asynchronous workshop for our design and cross-functional colleagues.

## The original experience

This experiment sought to refine an existing experience featuring two interstitial screens. These screens appeared when a customer selected "Pay Anyone" from the primary navigation and required dismissal before the customer could access the Pay Anyone interface.
