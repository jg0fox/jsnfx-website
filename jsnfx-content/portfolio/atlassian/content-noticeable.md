# Enhanced admin experiences at Atlassian

Supporting Jira and Confluence administrators as they register for and configure their fresh accounts.

## An extensive project involving numerous stakeholders

Our user research and data analytics revealed that new Jira and Confluence administrators were missing crucial guidance regarding essential concepts and functionalities. This shortage of assistance seemed to foster abandonment during account configuration and around the 2-week milestone. Beyond the abandonment issues, we observed that even among engaged admins, the frequency of team invitations remained remarkably low throughout those initial 2 weeks.

Enhancing our registration, configuration, and onboarding processes demanded substantial effort to achieve consensus among diverse stakeholders.

## Our working hypothesis

Following comprehensive collaboration with our partners through workshops and research sessions, we formulated a working hypothesis to provide direction for our initiatives.

> We believe that providing admins with clear instructions on what to accomplish once they arrive in the environment they established during account configuration will result in the admin feeling equipped to prepare their team for success and more confident to invite their team because they comprehend Confluence and the value it can deliver to their team.
>
> We'll know we are successful when admins execute core actions and they and their teams demonstrate higher retention by week 2.

**will result** in **[this outcome]**.

**We'll know we're right** when we see **[this metric/signal]**.

## My contribution to the project

This represented my inaugural project at Atlassian and I was thrilled to participate as the team's content design lead. Beyond delivering UX content assistance throughout all project components, I particularly appreciated exploring several critical areas:

- Developing user personas for Jira and Confluence
- Constructing a prioritized catalog of content enhancements and opportunity zones
- Anchoring the team's efforts in content theory, strategy, and established frameworks

## Narrative design explorations

In our effort to prioritize core messaging, I developed narrative structures representing our administrators' initial onboarding journeys.

The following illustration demonstrates an approach to align our narrative structure with crucial onboarding touchpoints.

## Efficient and straightforward content iterations

These preliminary content explorations showcase my preference for intentional placeholder content and swift iteration. In this illustration, I'm outlining content models for review with PM, design, and engineering teams.

## Results, insights, and final copy

Beyond delivering finalized copy, I collaborated with the team to document our findings and develop an internal growth content design educational curriculum.
