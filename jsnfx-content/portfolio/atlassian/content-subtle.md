# New admin experiences at Atlassian

Helping Jira and Confluence admins sign up for and set up their new accounts.

## A big project with many stakeholders

Our user research and data showed that new Jira and Confluence admins didn't have enough guidance on key ideas and features. This lack of help seemed to lead to people giving up during account setup and also at the 2-week point. Beyond people abandoning the process, we saw that even among active admins, the number of team invites was really low during those first 2 weeks.

Making our signup, setup, and onboarding flows better needed a massive effort to get different stakeholders working together.

## Our working theory

After exploring widely with our partners in workshops and research sessions, we created a working theory to give some direction to our work.

> We believe that giving admins clear steps on what to do once they reach the space they built during account setup will help the admin feel ready to set up their team for success and more willing to invite their team because they get Confluence and the value it can bring to their team.
>
> We'll know we've succeeded when admins do core tasks and they and their teams stick around more by week 2.

**will result** in **[this outcome]**.

**We'll know we're right** when we see **[this metric/signal]**.

## My part in the project

This was my first project at Atlassian and I was excited to jump in as the team's content design lead. Along with giving UX content help across all parts of the project, I really liked going deep into a few key areas:

- Making user types for Jira and Confluence
- Creating a ranked list of content improvements and chance areas
- Connecting the team's work to content theory, strategy, and frameworks

## Story design explorations

To focus on our main messages, I built story arcs that showed our admins' first onboarding experiences.

The next example shows an attempt to connect our story arc to key onboarding moments.

## Fast and easy content changes

These early content tests show my love for meaningful placeholder content and quick changes. In this example, I'm sketching out content models to review with PM, design, and engineering.

## Results, lessons, and final copy

Along with giving final copy, I also worked with the team to share our results and build an internal growth content design training course.
