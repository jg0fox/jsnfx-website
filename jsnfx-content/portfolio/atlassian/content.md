# New admin experiences at Atlassian

Helping Jira and Confluence admins sign up for and set up their new accounts.

## A large project with many stakeholders

Our user research and data analytics suggested that new Jira and Confluence admins lacked guidance on key concepts and features. This lack of support appeared to contribute to abandonment during account setup as well as at the 2-week mark. As well as the abandonment, we noticed that even among active admins, the rate of team invites was very low during those first 2 weeks.

Improving our signup, setup, and onboarding flows required a huge effort to bring a variety of stakeholders into alignment.

## Our working hypothesis

After going broad with our partners in workshops and research sessions, we drafted a working hypothesis to give some shape to our efforts.

> We believe that giving admins guidelines on what to do once they land in the space they created during account setup will result in the admin feeling prepared to set up their team for success and more confident to invite their team because they understand Confluence and the value it can bring to their team.
>
> We'll know we are successful when admins perform core actions and they and their teams are more highly retained by week 2.

## My role in the project

This was my first project at Atlassian and I was delighted to jump in as the team's content design lead. In addition to providing UX content support across all aspects of the project, I especially enjoyed diving deep into a few key areas:

- Creating user archetypes for Jira and Confluence
- Building a rank ordered list of content improvements and opportunity areas
- Grounding the team's work in content theory, strategy, and frameworks

## Narrative design explorations

In an effort to prioritize our core messages, I crafted narrative arcs representative of our admins initial onboarding experiences.

The following example demonstrates an attempt to map our narrative arc to key onboarding moments.

## Quick and simple content iterations

These early content explorations represent my affinity for purposeful placeholder content and rapid iteration. In this example, I'm blocking out content models to review with PM, design, and engineering.

## Results, takeaways, and final copy

In addition to handing off final copy, I also worked with the team to publish our results and create an internal growth content design educational course.
