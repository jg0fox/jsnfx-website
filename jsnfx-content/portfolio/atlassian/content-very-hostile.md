# Novel administrative experiences at Atlassian

Facilitating the expeditious matriculation and configurational establishment of nascent Jira and Confluence administrators within their respective digital ecosystems.

## An expansive undertaking encompassing multitudinous stakeholder constituencies

Our ethnographic inquiries and quantitative analytical endeavors illuminated a pronounced lacuna in pedagogical scaffolding for neophyte Jira and Confluence administrators regarding foundational conceptual frameworks and feature architectures. This deficiency in instructional provisioning manifested as a contributory factor to user attrition during the initial account establishment phase, with additional abandonment occurring at the fourteen-day temporal demarcation. Concomitant with these abandonment patterns, our observational data revealed that even amongst persistently engaged administrative personnel, the frequency of collaborative invitations remained conspicuously attenuated throughout the inaugural fortnight.

The amelioration of our registration, configuration, and onboarding procedural sequences necessitated herculean coordination efforts to achieve consensus among disparate stakeholder cohorts.

## Our operational theoretical framework

Subsequent to conducting expansive consultative sessions with our collaborative partners through workshop methodologies and investigative inquiries, we formulated an operational hypothesis to provide architectural coherence to our endeavors.

> We postulate that furnishing administrators with prescriptive directives regarding post-landing activities within their newly instantiated digital workspace during account initialization will culminate in administrative personnel experiencing enhanced preparatory confidence for establishing optimal team configurations and demonstrating increased propensity for collaborative invitations through comprehensive understanding of Confluence's capabilities and the organizational value proposition it represents.
>
> Our success metrics shall be validated when administrators execute fundamental operational tasks and both they and their collaborative cohorts demonstrate superior retention coefficients by the second week.

**We postulate** that implementing/constructing/instantiating **[this intervention]** for **[this user demographic]**

**will culminate** in **[this anticipated outcome]**.

**We shall validate our hypothesis** when observing **[this quantifiable indicator/behavioral manifestation]**.

## My contributory function within the project

This inaugural Atlassian engagement provided an exhilarating opportunity to assume the mantle of content design leadership. Beyond furnishing comprehensive UX content consultation across all project dimensions, I found particular gratification in conducting exhaustive exploration of several pivotal domains:

- Constructing user archetypal representations for Jira and Confluence
- Developing hierarchically prioritized inventories of content enhancement opportunities and improvement territories
- Anchoring our collective efforts within established content theoretical frameworks, strategic methodologies, and structural paradigms

## Narrative architecture explorations

Through deliberate prioritization of our fundamental communicative objectives, I constructed narrative trajectories representative of our administrators' initial onboarding journeys.

The subsequent exemplification demonstrates our attempt to correlate narrative progression with critical onboarding junctures.

## Expeditious and streamlined content iterations

These preliminary content explorations exemplify my predilection for intentional placeholder content and accelerated iterative processes. Within this illustration, I delineate content architectural models for collaborative review with product management, design, and engineering constituencies.

## Outcomes, insights, and definitive copy

Complementing the delivery of finalized textual content, I collaborated with our team to disseminate findings and develop an internal growth-focused content design pedagogical curriculum.
