# Novel administrative experiences at Atlassian

Facilitating the acquisition and configuration processes for nascent Jira and Confluence administrative personnel through comprehensive onboarding mechanisms.

## An expansive undertaking encompassing multitudinous stakeholders

Our investigative research methodologies and quantitative analytics substantiated that emergent Jira and Confluence administrators demonstrated deficiencies in comprehending fundamental conceptual frameworks and functional capabilities. This inadequacy in procedural guidance ostensibly precipitated user attrition throughout account initialization processes, particularly manifesting at the fourteen-day temporal benchmark. Concomitant with this abandonment phenomenon, we observed that amongst administratively engaged users, team invitation frequencies remained substantially diminished throughout the initial fortnight period.

Ameliorating our registration, configuration, and orientation workflows necessitated considerable collaborative endeavors to establish stakeholder consensus across disparate organizational constituencies.

## Our operational postulation

Subsequent to comprehensive exploratory sessions with collaborative partners through structured workshops and investigative protocols, we formulated an operational hypothesis to provide methodological framework for our initiatives.

> We postulate that furnishing administrators with prescriptive methodological guidelines regarding post-landing procedural execution within their instantiated workspace environments throughout account establishment will culminate in administrative personnel experiencing enhanced preparedness for facilitating team optimization while demonstrating increased confidence in colleague invitation processes through comprehensive Confluence understanding and value proposition recognition.
>
> We shall validate our theoretical framework when administrators demonstrate proficiency in fundamental operational behaviors, resulting in enhanced retention metrics for both administrators and their associated teams by the second week.

**We postulate** that implementing/constructing/generating **[this]** for **[this user demographic]**

**will culminate** in **[this outcome]**.

**We shall validate our hypothesis** when observing **[this quantitative indicator/behavioral signal]**.

## My contributory function within the initiative

This constituted my inaugural project at Atlassian, wherein I enthusiastically assumed responsibility as the content design leadership role. Beyond furnishing comprehensive UX content facilitation across all project dimensions, I derived particular satisfaction from intensive exploration of several pivotal domains:

- Constructing user archetypal representations for Jira and Confluence constituencies
- Developing hierarchically prioritized inventories of content enhancement opportunities and strategic areas
- Establishing foundational theoretical frameworks, strategic methodologies, and systematic approaches for team operations

## Narrative architectural explorations

Through deliberate message prioritization efforts, I developed narrative trajectories representative of administrator preliminary onboarding encounters.

The subsequent exemplification illustrates endeavors to correlate our narrative framework with pivotal onboarding junctures.

## Expeditious and streamlined content iterations

These preliminary content investigations exemplify my predilection for intentional provisional content and accelerated iterative processes. This demonstration involves content model structuring for collaborative review with product management, design, and engineering constituencies.

## Outcomes, insights, and finalized content

Beyond delivering conclusive content materials, I collaborated with team members to disseminate findings and establish internal growth-focused content design pedagogical curricula.
