# Tone spectrum explorer

An independent HTML application that assists users in establishing their position within the tone spectrum, examining relevant examples, and subsequently producing a standards document formatted in markdown.

## Inspiration

I dedicated countless years to mastering the art of positioning the tone indicator at precise locations along the spectrum. This process evolved into an instinctive capability for me, understanding how to achieve greater formality or incorporate playfulness, alongside the diverse linguistic and literary techniques I might employ to accomplish this, or to deconstruct existing content to comprehend their methodologies.

Throughout these years, I systematically documented this expertise to facilitate instruction for others. However, not everyone possessed the availability, curiosity, or circumstances to master the complexities of tone in the manner I had developed. Then suddenly, everything made sense. This interactive application, which essentially functions as a self-contained HTML document incorporating CSS and JavaScript, transforms my extensive literary and linguistic documentation concerning tone of voice into an instrument that feels dynamic, explorable, and enhanced with practical examples.

## It's a starting point

My intention was for this application to serve as a foundation for individuals to contemplate tone of voice more thoroughly, enabling them to record their preferred tonal characteristics and subsequently translate those preferences into formats readable by both humans and machines. This motivated me to construct a tone of voice standard framework so that, depending on where users position their specific spectrum preferences, they can produce a content guideline for that particular tonal approach and create positive outcomes.

Here's an example of a content guideline produced by this application:

# Tone of voice standards for _Spectrum: Playful vs. Serious | Position: 9/100 | Configuration: Strongly Playful_

### 4.3 Avoid (Anti-Patterns)

- ❌ **Technical precision**: Contradicts strongly playful positioning by introducing literal qualities
- ❌ **Functional descriptions**: Contradicts strongly playful positioning by introducing literal qualities
- ❌ **Uniform sentence structure**: Contradicts strongly playful positioning by introducing consistent qualities
- ❌ **Steady rhythm**: Contradicts strongly playful positioning by introducing consistent qualities
- ❌ **Logical information architecture**: Contradicts strongly playful positioning by introducing hierarchical qualities
