# Tone spectrum explorer

A standalone HTML tool that helps users define a position on the tone spectrum, view examples, then generate a standards document in markdown.

## Inspiration

I spent years figuring out how to place the tone needle at a certain place on the spectrum. it became an intuitive act for me, figuring out how to be more serious or playful, and all of the various linguistic and literary devices that I might use to do that, or to reverse engineer content to figure out how they did that.

And over the years, I even documented this knowledge so that I could teach it to other people. But not everyone had the time, interest, or opportunity to learn the ins-and-outs of tone in the way that I had designed. And then, it all clicked. This interactive tool, which is really just a standalone HTML page with some CSS and JavaScript, takes my years of literary and linguistic documentation around tone of voice and places it into a tool that feels interactive, navigable, and also enriched with examples.

## It's a starting point

I wanted this tool to be a starting point for people to think more deeply about tone of voice in a way that would allow them to document their preferred tone of voice preferences and then carry those preferences forward into human and machine-readable formats. This is why I put together a tone of voice standard schema so that, based on where a user sets their particular spectrum, they can generate a content standard for that type of tone of voice and make good things happen.

Here's an an example of a content standard generated by this tool:

# Tone of voice standards for _Spectrum: Playful vs. Serious | Position: 9/100 | Configuration: Strongly Playful_

- **Active Devices** (3-5 specific techniques):
1. **Metaphorical language**: Apply in creative expression to achieve imaginative quality
2. **Wordplay**: Apply in creative expression to achieve imaginative quality
3. **Anthropomorphism**: Apply in creative expression to achieve imaginative quality
- **Manifestation**: Content creative expression demonstrates strongly imaginative characteristics through metaphorical language

#### Sub-Dimension: Rhythmic Quality

- **Spectrum**: Varied ← → Consistent
- **Positioning**: Strongly Varied
- **Active Devices** (3-5 specific techniques):
1. **Dynamic sentence length**: Apply in rhythmic quality to achieve varied quality
2. **Alliteration**: Apply in rhythmic quality to achieve varied quality
3. **Tempo variation**: Apply in rhythmic quality to achieve varied quality
- **Manifestation**: Content rhythmic quality demonstrates strongly varied characteristics through dynamic sentence length

#### Sub-Dimension: Structural Approach

### 4.2 Secondary Devices (Use Sparingly)

- Modal verbs: Use occasionally to soften directives
- Rhetorical questions: Use sparingly for engagement
- Transitional phrases: Use when connecting complex ideas

### 4.3 Avoid (Anti-Patterns)

- ❌ **Technical precision**: Conflicts with strongly playful positioning by introducing literal characteristics
- ❌ **Functional descriptions**: Conflicts with strongly playful positioning by introducing literal characteristics
- ❌ **Uniform sentence structure**: Conflicts with strongly playful positioning by introducing consistent characteristics
- ❌ **Steady rhythm**: Conflicts with strongly playful positioning by introducing consistent characteristics
- ❌ **Logical information architecture**: Conflicts with strongly playful positioning by introducing hierarchical characteristics
- ❌ **Conventional presentation patterns**: Conflicts with strongly playful positioning by introducing hierarchical characteristics
- ❌ **Dense information packaging**: Conflicts with strongly playful positioning by introducing concentrated characteristics
- ❌ **Minimal exposition**: Conflicts with strongly playful positioning by introducing concentrated characteristics

### 4.4 Content Patterns

**Sentence structure**: Varied length, fragments acceptable, conversational flow
**Punctuation preferences**: Liberal use of exclamation points, em dashes, and ellipses for expressiveness
**Word choice principles**: Colloquial language, contractions, accessible vocabulary
**Rhythm/Pacing**: Quick tempo, varied rhythm, conversational pacing

## 5. Examples

### 5.1 Correct Usage

#### Interface Labels

```
Context: Primary navigation and action buttons
- "Let's get your account set up!"
- "You're doing great so far"
- "Oops! Something went wrong, but we'll fix it right up"
Why it works: Demonstrates strongly playful positioning through appropriate device usage
```

#### Notifications

- "Just a heads up - your session expires in 5 minutes"
Why it works: Maintains consistency with strongly playful tone across all touchpoints
```

#### Error Messages

```
Context: Input validation and system errors
Example: "Oops! That didn't work. Let's try again."
Why it works: Uses informal language and contractions
Why it works: Balances playful characteristics with user needs
```

### 5.2 Incorrect Usage with Corrections

```
❌ Incorrect: "Your request has been processed according to standard protocol."
Why it fails: Too formal - uses technical language that conflicts with playful/casual positioning
✓ Correct: "Got it! We're on it."
