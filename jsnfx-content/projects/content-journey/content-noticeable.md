## Content Journey

Content Journey represents a personal project I developed to unite the strategic foundation of content design—target audience, brand identity, key messaging—with the systematic evaluation aspects of LLM collaboration. Everything is integrated into a single, unified experience.

## How it operates

The application guides you through establishing your content framework: audience demographics, brand personality, editorial standards, and primary messaging. It then produces content across various formats utilizing compiled system prompts—each containing distinct parameters and structural guidance, yet engineered to function cohesively so results appear unified rather than fragmented.

The compelling aspect (compelling to me, at least) involves connecting two distinct models (Claude and GPT-4) where one LLM assesses the other's performance. The evaluation process measures content across clarity, relevance, tone, actionability, and accessibility utilizing linguistic and literary frameworks I integrated into the assessment prompt. You receive a detailed scorecard with targeted feedback, and can select "improve" to allow the secondary model to enhance content using that evaluative context.

## The results

You conclude with comparative analyses, performance metrics, and functionality to export all system prompts as Markdown, JSON, or PDF—either the complete collection or solely the optimal prompts.

The interface is admittedly somewhat cluttered, but provides substantial material for exploration. It represents my vision when merging that strategic foundation with the analytical component.
