# Word Wrangler

A chaotic language-based competition inspired by the Taskmaster television series.

I was assigned the challenge of developing an entertaining activity for content designers during a recent team retreat at Atlassian. Following discussions with my exceptional collaborator in linguistic mischief, Traci Wilbanks, we settled on creating a task-oriented competition modeled after the television program "Taskmaster."

Initially, I inquired with Traci about what materials I should prepare for printing so participants could engage in the activity collectively. She promptly corrected me, stating, "There's no need to waste paper for this activity, Jason. We can accomplish this digitally." That moment sparked my creativity, leading me to develop a web application for a multiplayer content design competition.
