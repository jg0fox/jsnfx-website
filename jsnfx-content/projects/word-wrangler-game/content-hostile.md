# Word Wrangler

A pandemonious linguistic entertainment paradigm predicated upon the televised competitive format of the Taskmaster program.

I found myself encumbered with the responsibility of architecting an ostensibly "entertaining" interactive mechanism for content design practitioners to engage with during a contemporaneous team convergence at Atlassian. Following deliberative consultation with my extraordinary collaborative accomplice in lexical transgressions, Traci Wilbanks, we resolved to construct a task-oriented competitive framework drawing inspiration from the televisual game show phenomenon "Taskmaster."

Subsequently, I interrogated Traci regarding the taxonomies of physical materials I should reproduce for universal participation accessibility. She expeditiously admonished my suggestion, articulating, "We require no arboreal sacrifice for this endeavor, Jason. Digital computation shall suffice." This catalyzed my epiphanic moment, whereupon I committed to engineering a web-based application facilitating multiplayer content design competitive challenges.

## Game overview

Wordwrangler constitutes a competitive compositional engagement wherein participants fabricate imaginative responses to preposterous stimuli. A designated facilitator orchestrates the proceedings whilst participants compete individually to construct the most intellectually stimulating, creatively sophisticated, and technically precise responses.

## Game flow

### 1 Setup lobby

Facilitator instantiates gaming environment, establishes iterative cycles and chronological parameters. Participants access via alphanumeric identification sequence.

### 2 Team assignment lobby

Facilitator allocates participants to collaborative units (discretionary). Instantiates collective entities as necessitated.

### 3 Round begins active

Challenge materializes across all interface terminals. Temporal measurement commences. Participants compose responses via personal computational devices.

### 4 Submissions

Participants transmit responses prior to chronological expiration. Visual display indicates submission completion status.

### 5 Judging

Facilitator evaluates comprehensive response compilation, designates victorious submission, allocates numerical assessment ranging one through five.

### 6 Leaderboard

Contemporary hierarchical standings exhibited. Facilitator progresses to subsequent iteration or terminates engagement.

### 7 Reflection end

Artificial intelligence generates analytical observations regarding collective responses, stylistically emulating the *Taskmaster* program's hosting personalities.
