# Word Wrangler

A chaotic language game based on the Taskmaster game show.

I was asked to create a "fun" game for content designers to play during a recent team gathering at Atlassian. After talking with my amazing partner in language crime, Traci Wilbanks, we chose to create a task-based game inspired by the TV game show "Taskmaster."

I then asked Traci what kinds of materials I should print out so that everyone could play the game together. And she quickly scolded me and said, "We don't need to kill any trees for this game, Jason. We can do it with computers." And that's when my idea struck, and I chose to design a web app for a multiplayer content design challenge game.
